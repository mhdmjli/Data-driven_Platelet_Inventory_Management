# Data-driven Platelet Inventory Management
The proposed data-driven model can be used to determine daily platelet ordering quantities for a hospital that procures blood products from a central supplier, and hence the remaining age of the ordered units is subject to uncertainty. The model can be viewed as a linear demand prediction model with the objective of the decision-making problem integrated through the fitness function.
