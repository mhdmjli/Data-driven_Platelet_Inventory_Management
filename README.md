# Data-driven Platelet Inventory Management
The decision model is data-driven and can be used to determine the daily platelet ordering quantities for a hospital that procures blood products from a central supplier, and hence the remaining age of the ordered units is subject to uncertainty. The model can be viewed as a linear demand prediction model with the objective of the decision-making problem integrated through the fitness function.
